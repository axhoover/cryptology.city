# Symmetric private information retrieval (Single-server)
Symmetric private information retrieval is a stronger version of [[Single-Server Private Information Retrieval]] that in addition to protecting the querier's privacy, also protects the data privacy. The multi-server, information-theoretic version was introduced by [[GIKM00 - Protecting Data Privacy in Private Information Retrieval Scheme|GIKM00]], but follow-up works showed how to construct computationally secure versions based on assumptions.
