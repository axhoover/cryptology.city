# One-way functions (OWF)
A one-way function (OWF) is a function (or family of functions) which is easy to compute but hard to invert. One-way functions are associated with Impagliazzo's "Minicrypt" world.  They are generally considered the minimal primitive for interesting cryptography to exist (at least in a classical world).
