# Collision-resistant hash function (CRH)
A *collision resistant hash function (CRH)* is a stronger version of a [[One-way function]]. More than. making it hard to find a pre-image (invert) the function, a CRH requires that it is hard to find two inputs that have the same output, i.e., a collision.
