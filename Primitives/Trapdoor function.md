# Trapdoor function (TDF)
A trapdoor function (TDF) is a function (or family of functions) which is easy to compute but hard to invert (like a [[One-way functions|OWF]]), but is in fact easy to invert if given the *trapdoor*. Trapdoor functions are associated with Impagliazzo's "Cryptomania" world.  Their existence implies many different public-key cryptography primitives.
