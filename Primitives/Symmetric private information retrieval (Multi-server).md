# Symmetric private information retrieval (Multi-server)
Symmetric private information retrieval is a stronger version of [[Private information retrieval (Multi-server)]] that in addition to protecting the querier's privacy, also protects the data privacy. It was first introduced by [[GIKM98 - Protecting Data Privacy in Private Information Retrieval Scheme|GIKM98]], which showed how to construct it in the multi-server setting with information-theoretic security.
