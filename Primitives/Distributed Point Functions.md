# Distributed Point Functions (DPFs)
A *Distributed Point function* allows one to generate a pair of keys which can be used to evaluate two functions which are equal everywhere except on one specific point. It was introduced in  [[GI14 - Distributed Point Functions and Their Applications|GI14]]. Security requires that given one of the keys, an adversary cannot tell which point the accompanying key differs on.
