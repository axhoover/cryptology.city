# Bounded-Error Probabilistic Polynomial-Time (BPP)
The class of decision problems solvable by anÂ [[Nondeterministic Polynomial-Time|NP]] machine such that
1. If the answer is 'yes' then at least 2/3 of the computation paths accept.
2. If the answer is 'no' then at most 1/3 of the computation paths accept.
(Here all computation paths have the same length.)
