# Complement of [[Nondeterministic Polynomial-Time|NP]] (coNP)
The complement complexity class of [[Nondeterministic Polynomial-Time|NP]].

## Known relationships
- IfÂ [[Nondeterministic Polynomial-Time|NP]] = coNP, then any inconsistent Boolean formula of size n has a proof of inconsistency of size polynomial in n.
