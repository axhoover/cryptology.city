# Cryptology City
Welcome to Cryptology City! Jump right in by taking a look navigating the site on the left!

This wiki is a collection of cryptographic primitives and reductions between them. It is meant to serve as a large repository of cryptographic information and make it easy to understand the relationships between different primitives. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to make an account and [contribute](https://github.com/axhoover/cryptology.city)!

Errors? Omissions? Misattributions? Your favorite primitive/assumption not here? Then please contribute to the city by submitting a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/axhoover/cryptology.city). The repository is just a copy of an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, so that is the best way to make modifications. For any other recommendations or issues, please reach out to the Cryptology City [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cryptology.city), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptologycity), or [email](mailto:cryptologycity@gmail.com).

## Structure
`./Primitives` — descriptions of different cryptographic primitives
`./Assumptions` — common assumptions that are made in cryptography
`./References` — papers which are referenced
`./Folklore` — results that are well known, but do not explicitly appear in literature
`./Complexity` — complexity classes that are relevant to certain results
`./Glossary` — terms or common concepts which are related and do not fall into the other categories

## What is Cryptology City?
Cryptology City is a passion project that I started just after I finished my PhD in Cryptography. I always liked the [Complexity Zoo](https://complexityzoo.net/) when I was a younger student and really interested in Theoretical Computer Science. I found it really fun to just read about random complexity classes, and interesting that people had even bothered to define and compare them to more standard classes.

In my (short) time as a cryptographer, I've realized that this type of systematization is really rare to come by, and that it would be really useful in many subfields of Computer Science. My hope is that Cryptology City serves as a useful resource to new and old cryptographers as a place to centralize information about cryptographic assumptions and primitives. I think there is a lot more work to be done in cryptography and that searching prior works on Google Scholar is often time consuming or insufficient to get a good grasp of what is out there.

If you're a cryptographer, you're more than welcome to help to build the city out, correct mistakes, or provide your own suggestions for what would be helpful or an improvement! For newer cryptographers or those just curious to learn about the math and models behind security, have fun looking at what's out there, too! Hopefully you can find interesting problems to solve.
