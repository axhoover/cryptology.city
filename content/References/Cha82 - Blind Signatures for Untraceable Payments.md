# [Cha82] Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments

**Authors:** David Chaum | **Venue:** CRYPTO 1982 | [Source](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-0602-4_18)

## Abstract
Automation of the way we pay for goods and services is already underway, as can be seen by the variety and growth of electronic banking services available to consumers. The ultimate structure of the new electronic payments system may have a substantial impact on personal privacy as well as on the nature and extent of criminal use of payments. Ideally a new payments system should address both of these seemingly conflicting sets of concerns.
