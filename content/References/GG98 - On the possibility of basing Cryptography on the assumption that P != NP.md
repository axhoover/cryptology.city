# [GG98] On the possibility of basing Cryptography on the assumption that $P \neq NP$

**Authors:** Oded Goldreich, Shafi Goldwasser | **Venue:** Theory of Cryptography Library | [Source](https://eprint.iacr.org/1998/005)

## Abstract
Recent works by Ajtai and by Ajtai and Dwork bring to light the old (general) question of whether it is at all possible to base the security of cryptosystems on the assumption that $P \neq NP$. We discuss this question and in particular review and extend a two-decade old result of Brassard regarding this question. Our conclusion is that the question remains open.
