# [KO97] Replication is not needed: single database, computationally-private information retrieval

**Authors:** Eyal Kushilevitz, Rafail Ostrovsky | **Venue:** FOCS 1997 | [Source](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/646125)

## Abstract
We establish the following, quite unexpected, result: replication of data for the computational private information retrieval problem is not necessary. More specifically, based on the quadratic residuosity assumption, we present a single database, computationally private information retrieval scheme with $O(n^{\epsilon})$ communication complexity for any $\epsilon > 0$.
