# [GMW91] Proofs that yield nothing but their validity or all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proof systems

## Abstract
We present a general technique for the design of cryptographic protocols.  The technique is based on the notion of zero-knowledge proofs, which are proofs that yield nothing but their validity.  We show that if all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proof systems, then any function that can be computed in probabilistic polynomial time can be computed in a way that is secure against any computationally bounded adversary. The protocols we construct are fault tolerant in the sense that they can tolerate a certain number of faulty processors. We also show how to use our technique to design protocols for various cryptographic tasks, such as oblivious transfer and secure multiparty computation.
